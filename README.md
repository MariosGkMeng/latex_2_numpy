# What?
A Python module that converts Latex equations to numpy.

# Why?

1. It is easier to write and **review** a scientific-computing algorithm using the original mathematical syntax, rather than the computer programming expression
2. It can be linked to scientific documentation and even publications, without the need to program something from the beginning
3. It can eliminate the need to learn programming-language specific rules (why should you know which module is needed to use linear algebra operations?)
4. Since it looks prettier, it can "save you some sanity" during work when you need to follow strict deadlines and perform a lot of tasks

## Example
A small computational example from the field of Reinforcement Learning can be found at the image below
See the python code (left), compared to the math format on the right.
